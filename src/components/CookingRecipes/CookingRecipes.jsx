        <h3>  What are zeppole? </h3>
       </div>
        A classic Italian dessert, Zeppole are tiny
        donuts that are fried until perfectly golden brown, then tossed in an
        orange sugar. More similar to cake donuts than yeasted ones, zeppole are
        similarly fried rather than baked, resulting in a golden, crisp result
        that is still light and fluffy in the middle. In Italy, larger zeppole
        are often served filled with pastry cream. For a take on that version,
        use a paring knife to poke a small hole in the side of the donut, then
        fill with pastry cream using a piping bag Tip: Use the filling recipe
        from these eclairs! Top tips for making zeppole: — Fry in a combo of
        vegetable and olive oil. This gives the zeppole a more sophisticated,
        deeper flavor, but you can go with all vegetable oil if you prefer. —
        Use a deep-fry thermometer. If you have one, now is a good time to use
        it. The right temperature oil ensures the batter is cooked with the
        perfect golden exterior. — Topping your zeppole. We went with an orange
        sugar mixture, but you can also use powdered sugar if you prefer.</p>
